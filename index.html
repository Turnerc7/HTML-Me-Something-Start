         <h1>My Family Trip to Gulf Shores Alabama</h1>
      <p>My family and I went to Gulf Shores Alabama for a week. We stayed in a beach house right on the beach. With amazing views of the Gulf.
          The weather was perfect and the water was warm. We spent most of our time on the beach. It was a great trip!</p>
